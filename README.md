# Screen capture

**1. Record your computer screen and webcam simultaneously.**

**2. Allow you to customize screen capture and frame rate .**

Screen recording is an excellent way of explaining things (problems or solutions) to other people.
You can conveniently make tutorials showing people how to do things or how they can fix different issues they might be facing.
With that being said, having a webcam recording function available alongside screen recording allows you to better connect with your audience.
It gives a more realistic vibe to the video and makes it more absorbing.
